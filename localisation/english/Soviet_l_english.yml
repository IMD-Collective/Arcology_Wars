 ##Leader Descriptions
 dmitry_yazov_DESC:0 "In Yazov's Soviet Union it's as if Molotov never died in '86. Everything is a mirror image of it's old self albeit with fresher paint, and the people enjoy the stability it brings very much so. Though Yazov's Union cannot be defined as stagnant because it is perpetuating the old order to a tee which inherently was anti stagnancy. Former general secretary Vyacheslav Molotov's doctrines proved the be ideal for the Soviet Union in the past so why change them? A short list of the USSR's most defining features are it's planned economy that communicates through a computer network that enhances the central planning committee's ability to co-ordinate and draft up industrial plans based on relevant and actual information, bureaucrats that are shuffled every 5 years, anti-gerontocracy laws, severe penalization for administrative level nepotism and a stick and carrot style state incentivized reward system to encourages people to work harder in return for raises and promotions. Everything that could have sunk the USSR in the past has been dodged, shot and forgotten. But right now the Union faces new problems, issues that can only be classified as outside of any policy planner's possible field of vision and imagination, it's time for the USSR to decide on what's next, and Yazov has accepted he is growing too old for these kinds of pivotal tasks. In his mind he sees his work as complete, Lenin's red banner stands peerless atop the piles of the old empires, all thanks to him. Revolution after revolution, coup after coup until there wasn't anyone strong enough left to stand up to soviet power, but despite the damage the Yazov years have done to the world, rebels and unifies teem in the old nations that he's assassinated, guns and bullets can be given to the various regional ethnic separatists that the USSR has propped up to fight back against these efforts, but one of these days our grip might weaken..."
 oleg_baklanov_DESC:0 "Oleg Baklanov, former Minister of Finance and now General Secretary of the CPSU, is a man who dreams of the stars. While such men as Pugo and Yazov have looked forwards, he, instead, has looked upwards. Comrade Baklanov is a man who does not support brutal expansionism, bathing Europe and the Middle East in crimson showers from Soviet soldiers - instead, it is his belief that money is power. He does not believe that the military should take preference over other matters - instead, it is his belief that the Union must move further into the final frontier. He has firmly rejected Pugoist notions of violence and world revolution - and the Supreme Soviet has agreed with him.\n\nWith his fighting against expansion via the barrel of an AK-74, Baklanov's views have improved his position in not only the rigid Soviet power structure, but the eyes of the people, as well. Pugo has been locked out of the Kremlin, and the workers of the world march forwards, united in diversity and in hope. Looking upwards has brought the Union forwards in an ultimate victory, as Oleg Baklanov becomes the most powerful man in the world."
 boris_pugo_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the West, the Union has emerged as the sole hyperpower in a new world. But each world must have its order. The practice of capitalism has not been fully stamped out. Some in the Union believe that it is best to maintain a more Soviet-centric approach, and bring these countries under the Soviet arm with economic domination. Others, though, feel that the Soviet Union must spread communism and workers' liberation throughout the world with the might of her armed forces. What is there to say about this movement that has not already been said by its rivals? And what is there to say about Boris Pugo, the leader of the movement? He has been called a subversive anti-communist, a wild Trotskyite, and a Russian nationalist.\n\nBut the truth is that Boris Pugo is none of those things, but instead, a visionary of a new Union. Born in Kalinin in 1937, Pugo is something of an outsider to the Supreme Soviet, itself said to orbit around the Kremlin as the Moon orbits around the Earth. But what he lacks in time in the Supreme Soviet, he holds in political experience. Pugo has worked alongside the KGB and the Soviet Armed Forces, ensuring that they are represented in the political sphere - and in turn, they ensure that he maintains his position.\n\nNow, with the ascension of Pugo to the spot of General Secretary, he intends to pay back those he has helped in the past, as well as bring the movement he leads to national leadership. The countries around the Union cower in fear, for they know that their movements towards capitalism are no longer going unnoticed by the Soviet Union. The time has come for the Soviet Union to bury capitalism once and for all, and Boris Pugo is the undertaker."

 ##Events
 soviet.1.t:0 "16th Convocation Session, 2008"
 soviet.1.d:0 "The date is the 8th January, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has come together for its 2008 Session. Its 542 members filed into the building, the Grand Stalingrad Palace. A large, white building with gold edges and a dark green roof. The building itself was very imposing, overlooking the Volga River as well, and the engrained letters “CPSU” into the roof added to that. The interior meanwhile, had similar white walls, with small stripes of gold vertically going along the walls. Juxtaposing this white interior was a calm blue ceiling, centred with a chandelier in the shape of a ring, and the floor had rows of wooden seats arranged in a semi-circular position. During the general noise of people coming in and chatting, some of the more important members of the Soviet had a concerned discussion. These concerns were mainly focused on budget reallocations, due to the flow of weapons into Europe being unable to be sustained. Reallocating fundings from the public sector into restarting the military-industry would be the only way to sustain the same flow of support to European allies, and the majority of those involved in the discussions were concerned that would mean the populace would grow unhappy. Meanwhile, General Secretary Yazov sat to himself. His main concerns were the decline of his health, and he realised he was growing too old to continue running the Union. However, he was still unsure of who to pick as his successor, with the main options being Boris Pugo and Oleg Baklanov. After a long while of filing in and getting settled, Yazov stood up from his seat at the front of the room, facing everybody in the Soviet. Wobbling, his hand firmly gripped his cain, and he observed the audience. One eye lazy and drooping, his gaze had lost the stern and cold feeling it once had before his prior stroke. When everybody had settled, he welcomed everyone in the Soviet. He had decided that this session would be to decide the right successor, in order to gain a final verdict. Upon this announcement, both Pugo and Baklanov stood up to present their preferred way of continuing the Union. Pugo began first, expressing his ideas on the next steps forward after Yazov’s resignation. The core of his ideology involves the Union capitalising on the chaos it had been causing globally, particularly in Europe, and starting a campaign of plunder and conquest. He argued that this would bring in economic growth, via exploiting its newly acquired territories. After sitting back down, Baklanov began his talk. His own ideas involve mainly soft economic power domination and projection, rather than attempting conquest and looting. Due to the earlier concerns of budget reallocation, people tended to agree with Baklanov’s ideas, however Yazov was still unsure. Before the Congress was due to end, Baklanov told Pugo directly that he himself would best maintain the Union’s legacy, in front of most of the Supreme Soviet and Yazov himself."

 soviet.4.t:0 "Comrade Yazov Steps Down"
 soviet.4.d:0 "Today, Comrade Dimitry Yazov, leader of our great union, has officially stepped down from the office of General Secretary of the Communist Party, citing his increased age. Leader since Molotov's death in 1986, Yazov has continued the status quo of the former leader in his 22-year tenure, with a technocratic and strongly anti-nepotistic approach to affairs. Yazov's rule was marked primarily by the collapse of the United States. In the aftermath, there has been a Soviet domination of Europe, as capitalism has been kicked to the curb - hopefully for good. The Union's gross domestic product has also skyrocketed with Comrade Yazov as General Secretary, nearly doubling since he took office in 1986. The world has already begun to recognise our dominance in the new century, naming it "the Soviet Century".\n\nIn response to General Secretary Yazov's resignation, the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has called for a snap election. Two candidates have emerged in the aftermath of Yazov's death; Oleg Baklanov and Boris Pugo. Boris Pugo, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, is, to put it one way, more globally-minded than Baklanov, supporting liberation of the last capitalist lands of Earth. However, Comrade Baklanov, Minister of Finance, is far more internally-focused, supporting a less visible foreign policy approach. While both are expected to campaign hard and present their case to the Union, Comrade Baklanov has a clear advantage over Chairman Pugo, whose rhetoric has been perceived as jingoistic and indenciary."

 ##News
 sovietnews.1.t:0 "USSR Pursuing More Agressive Relations"
 sovietnews.1.d:0 "The 2008 Supreme Soviet meeting of the 16th convocation session has reportedly voted on the adoption of more aggressive foreign policy and international relations towards the European neighborhood of nations, with potential of new at areas being added as risk zones for future USSR direct intervention. \n\nThe meeting was in favor of the ideas brought fourth by the Chairman of the Presidium, Boris Pugo, who was the initiator of debate regarding taking on new global aspirations. Experts have predicted these new measures would mean taking the former east block states, and potential invasions of western European nations. What it means for the rest of the world is still up for debate though, as many believe the USSR is not interested in expanding outside the Euro-Zone."
 sovietnews.1.a:0 "Really..."
 sovietnews.2.t:0 "Change In The Supreme Soviet"
 sovietnews.2.d:0 "The 2008 Supreme Soviet meeting of the 16th convocation session has reportedly voted on the adoption of a more global outlook towards international relations. What the change entails is still a mystery, but messages to the global press regarding this issue have used positive wording towards global relations and references to the drafting of plans for a COM-ECON style organization that's aim is to repair damage caused by the war and the world scale social anarchy that ensued after the collapse of various per-war central governments. While many are rejoicing that worst is over and end tunnel light is nearing, skeptics have noted the possibility of foul play, with some going as far as saying this is nothing more then a carte-blanch for their SOUs to loot the desperate."
