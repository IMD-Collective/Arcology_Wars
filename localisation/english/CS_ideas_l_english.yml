 ######Bosnia#####
 BOS_Islamic_Republic:0 "Islamic Republic"
 BOS_Islamic_Republic_desc:0 "Bosnia is an outlier in Europe, and most certainly within the Balkans. Rather than following socialism, democracy, or a typical junta, our country is governed as an islamic republic, in accordance with shariah and the fatwas of the Sunni muftis. Our status as an islamic republic, however, has attracted criticism from both non-Muslim Bosnians, who argue it ignores their status, and extremist Muslims, who argue it does not go far enough in ensuring the basis of Allah and the Quran in the country."
 BOS_Jihadist_Pressure:0 "Jihadist Pressure"
 BOS_Jihadist_Pressure_desc:0 "Since the War of Independence, our Islamic Republic has had a large presence of Jihadists, consisting of both radical Bosniak Muslims and terrorists from the rest of the Muslim world. Since the end of the war, these Jihadists have only come into Bosnia in increased numbers, convinced by the presence of terrorist leaders such as Osama bin Laden and Abdelkader Mokhtari in the country. This has led to a large number of militant groups forming in the country, most significantly al-Qaeda in the Balkan Peninsula. In recent years, Jihadist groups have become frustrated with the pace of the government, and some members have even called for the overthrow of the government."
 BOS_Secularist_Movement:0 "Secularist Movement"
 BOS_Secularist_Movement_desc:0 "Among the cities of Bosnia, there is a growing civil resistance movement, primarily among the Serbian and Bosnian sections of our country, who have taken to the streets, openly declaring their desire to end the era of Izetbegovism and create a new, secular Bosnia. This civil resistance movement will need to be dealt with in order to fully stabilise Bosnia."
 
 ######Germany#####
 GER_Stasi_Securocracy:0 "Stasi Securocracy"
 GER_Stasi_Securocracy_desc:0 "The State Security Ministry has become powerful and elite, puppeteering the government from the shadows. With Stasi and the Government now one being, the general population has become obedient and ideologically submissive to propaganda. During the Neu Volkshammer Massacre on the 5th October 2008, the Stasi sieged and opened fire on the legislative building when the CDU attempted to forcefully push reforms through legislature, after a referendum was accused to be invalid by both sides. After most of the dissenting politicans of the country were killed in the Neu Volkshammer, the Stasi, Military and loyal civilan bureaucrats agreed to establish a new junta administration, which previously led the entirety of inhabitable Germany. When the civil war started, the Stasi government remained in control of the north."
 GER_Frontline_Commissars:0 "Frontline Commisars"
 GER_Frontline_Commissars_desc:0 "In the old Soviet system, commissars were simply regional commanders who handled administration and recruitment into the army. However, now we have created a new way of handling commissars. Stasi agents have been integrated into the frontline, allowing for the creation of a structure in the chaos of war, and bolstering soldiers’ morale. Empowering their men with speeches and words, they lead the assault and make sure nobody stays behind."

 WGR_The_Manic_Struggle_desc:0 "We'd rather perish then return to the panopticon."
 WGR_Anarchist_Brigades:0 "Anarchist Brigades"
 WGR_Anarchist_Brigades_desc:0 "The less powerful wing of the CDU is made up of anarchist militias. Forming brigades of armed workers, they are much less organised than the conventional divisions used by the main wing of the party. Despite being less organised, the brigades are effective by utilising guerrilla warfare to disrupt the enemy, as well as human wave tactics to overwhelm them. They are valued members of the CDU’s military, and have helped with major operations using their strategies."
 
 ######USSR#####
 SOV_Pax_Sovietica_I:0 "Pax Sovietica"
 SOV_Pax_Sovietica_I_desc:0 "With the Soviet Union now being the only superpower, the world has entered a new era of “peace”. The Union has inherited the Roman and British hegemonial periods of peace, and is now the global policeman. With no rival to combat its efforts across the world, the USSR has decreased the budget on defence. Greater funds have been allocated to civilian sectors, due to the fact that this new-found peace has given time to focus on development and technological furtherment."

 SOV_High_Suicide_Rates_I:0 "High Suicide Rates"
 SOV_High_Suicide_Rates_I_desc:0 "The Soviet Union has elevated itself to the sole superpower of the world, with its influence extending far and wide with no enemy to rival it. It is seen as the most developed country remaining. Yet, despite all of this, conditions in Russia are miserable and dreary. Risks of famines, extreme cold, and bad weather have turned half of the country and alot of what little arable terrain we had into a near wasteland. The people are depressed, and are unable to truly believe in the apparent “victory” they have achieved, due to the destruction of major cities and the oncoming nuclear winter."

 ######France and neighbors######
 FRA_Military_State:0 "Military State"
 FRA_Military_State_desc:0 "During the 90s, France's government collapsed under the pressure of post-nuclear troubles. The Fifth Republic had succumbed to regionalist movements, radicalists, and reactionaries. Though, France's Cold-War era militarization had not been in vain,since the military, in cooperation with several corporations and government organizations, was able to seize control of the state and expel any opposition before it completely disintegrated. By 2001, general Maurice Schmitt, a hardened veteran of France's past conflicts, arose as the leader of the new military state. In the 21st century, France has developed into a fully militarized state, with a ruling class of corporate elites, and military leaders who are bent on recovering France into a forceful global power."
 FRA_Savoy_Crisis:0 "Savoy Crisis"
 FRA_Savoy_Crisis_desc:0 "Savoy had become an autonomous region of France under the military government, but its security was always threatened by Occitania's interests. In 2006, the left-wing nationalist government of Occitania sought to act on their claim on this region, and launched a coup on the Savoyard government, which installed an Occitan puppet government. This was only possible with the help of the Soviets, who had recently started aiding Occitania as an ally against the anti-Soviet French government. France engaged the Occitanian-Soviet forces, but lost and was forced to stand down or else risk flaring tensions with the soviets. This geopolitical and military defeat has been humilitaing for France, and it has taken a considerable effort to recover morale."
 FRA_Euro_Coop:0 "ECL Founder"
 FRA_Euro_Coop_desc:0 "In the early 2000s, French leaders started up an initiative to create more unity between compatible European nations such as Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. Together they established the European Cooperation League, or ECL. This was to be a revival of pan-Europeanism, which had been completely abandoned after the nuclear war. The ECL functions similarly to the European Economic Community, in the sense that it creates a common market and promotes communal cooperation between member nations, but also has a strong focus on military cooperation and development. France's role as the founder gives it the legitimacy and power to rope in the separatist breakaways of Brittany and Normandy through treaties and funding of loyalists."
 OCC_Soviet_Aid:0 "Soviet Aid"
 OCC_Soviet_Aid_desc:0 "Ever since the early 2000s, the Soviets have been wary of France's anti-Soviet militarization and pan-European revivalism. The French breakaway nation of Occitania proved to be a good ally to counter this threat. Occitania's vehement anti-French rhetoric and left-wing leanings were a perfect ideological fit for the Soviet's plans. Because of this, Occitania has been receiving supplies, funding, training, and resources from the USSR with hopes to someday use Occitania to destroy France. This aid has been very useful to Occitania, and the nation has developed a more effective industry, and a capable military."
 OCC_French_Nationalist_Insurgency:0 "French Nationalist Insurgency"
 OCC_French_Nationalist_Insurgency_desc:0 "Although Occitania's populist regime has captured the support of most citizens, some are nostalgic for French governance. They prefer that France be unified once more, and fail to adhere to Occitanian nationalist rhetoric. Most of this resistance is steeped in old anti-socialist liberalism and Gaullist-esque nationalism. With Occitania increasingly becoming a Soviet satellite, resistance from the capital-owning classes, and from French nationalists has turned militant. For the past several years, Occitania has been plagued with terrorist attacks from French-funded and trained insurgent organizations. The government of Occitania has struggled to keep these terrorists under control since they receive support from almost all European anti-Soviet nations."
