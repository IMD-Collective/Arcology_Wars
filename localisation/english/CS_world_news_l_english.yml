 world.1.t:0 "Boris Pugo Becomes CPSU General Secretary"
 world.1.d:0 "Breaking news from Moscow today as it has been announced that Soviet Premier, Boris Pugo, has been officially elected as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Following the resignation of prior General Secretary Dimitry Yazov, Pugo emerged as a jingoist candidate, in opposition to Finance Minister Oleg Baklanov's technocratic views.\n\nWith Pugo's victory, every move of the Union's neighbours is now under intense scrutiny from the Politburo. Pugo preaches views of reclaiming the Soviet sphere through shows of military force. Already, it seems that the Union has begun to eye up her neighbours in the former Eastern Bloc, who have been seen as ripe for the re-taking."

 world.2.t:0 "Oleg Baklanov Becomes CPSU General Secretary"
 world.2.d:0 "Breaking news from Moscow today as it has been announced that Soviet Minister of Finance, Oleg Baklanov, has been officially elected as General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Following the resignation of prior General Secretary Dimitry Yazov, Baklanov emerged as a technocratic candidate, in opposition to the jingoism of Boris Pugo, now-former Premier.\n\nAs Baklanov proves victorious, the Soviet Union now looks towards a friendlier face in terms of international affairs, as well as a renewed effort towards the stars and increasing economic dominance. Eduard Shevardn, former First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party and current Minister of Foreign Affairs, is expected to play a large role when it comes to the new government's policies abroad."
