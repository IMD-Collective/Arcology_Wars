 leifeng.1.d:0 ""Hand over the money!" Ling was scared for her life. Being mugged in a dark alleyway by two armed men was certainly a terrifying experience. "Please, my wallet's inside my apartment! I don't have anything for you!"\n\nThe man who had demanded Ling's money turned to his comrade. "Well, then," he laughed menacingly, "I guess we'll have to take something else." Suddenly, a "halt!" echoed throughout the alley. The two muggers turned around to see a strange man in the shadows. "Leave the woman alone!" The mysterious man said. "Or what?" the mugger responded mockingly.\n\nAt once, everything became a blur, as the stranger attacked the mugger who had spoken, throwing him to the ground and cracking his skull open. The second mugger, stunned, tried to flee, but the mysterious man was quicker, using the first one's rifle. The mugger, shot in the back, fell into the dirt.\n\n"T-thank you, mister," Ling said, amazed at the man's help. "Please," the stranger said, "I am your comrade. Let me help you up." When Ling got a glimpse of the stranger's face, she couldn't help but be reminded of someone. As she walked to her door, she said, "Hey, has anyone ever told you that you look like..."\n\nWhen she turned to talk to him, he was gone. As if he was never there."
